# moodle-mod_moodleoverflow

This plugin enables Moodle users to create a stackoverflow-like forum.
The plugin has the same features as the moodle forum.
Additionally, users can rate posts and have an own rating score.
Users, who have started a discussion, can mark a post as helpful and teachers can mark a post as solution.


## Installation
This plugin should go into `mod/mooodleoverflow`.
